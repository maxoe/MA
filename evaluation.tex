\section{Experiments}
In this section, we evaluate the running time and behavior of our algorithms of chapter~\ref{ch:Algorithm} in various experiments and describe the underlying data. Our machine runs openSUSE Leap 15.3, has \SI{128}{\giga\byte} (8x\SI{16}{\giga\byte}) of \SI{2133}{\mega\hertz} DDR4 RAM, and a 4-core Intel Xeon E5-1630v3 CPU which runs at \SI{3.7}{\giga\hertz}. The code is written in Rust and compiled with cargo 1.59.0-nightly using the release profile with lto~=~true and codegen-units~=~1.
