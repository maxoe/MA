\section{List of Symbols and Designations}
\label{app:symbols}

We use Greek symbols for theoretical and abstract concepts such as the shortest distance between two nodes or an arbitrary valid node potential. Concrete functions and procedures, i.e., those with definitions, have verbose names. Algorithmic functions and procedures for which pseudocode is provided use \algofunction{SmallCaps}.

\begin{tabular}{rp{0.79\textwidth}}
	$\potential_t(v)$         & A node potential to $t$                                                                                                                    \\
	$\distance(s,t)$          & Shortest distance between $s$ and $t$                                                                                                      \\

	$\breakTime(v)$           & A function which assigns each node of a route the length of the break at the node or zero, if the route does not take a break at the node.
	\\
	$\route$                  & A route consisting of a path and a function $\breakTime(v)$                                                                                \\
