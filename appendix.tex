\section{List of Symbols and Designations}
\label{app:symbols}

We use Greek symbols for theoretical and abstract concepts such as the shortest distance between two nodes or an arbitrary valid node potential. Concrete functions and procedures, i.e., those with definitions, have verbose names. Algorithmic functions and procedures for which pseudocode is provided use \algofunction{SmallCaps}.

\begin{tabular}{rp{0.85\textwidth}}
	$\potential_t(v)$         & A node potential to $t$                                                                                                                   \\
	$\distance(s,t)$          & Shortest distance between $s$ and $t$.                                                                                                    \\

	$\drivingtime(s,t)$       & Driving time of the shortest route between $s$ and $t$                                                                                    \\
