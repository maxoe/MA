  abstract = {We survey recent advances in algorithms for route planning in transportation networks. For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

After a quick preprocessing phase, we can compute all distances from a given source in the graph with essentially a linear sweep over all vertices. Because this sweep is independent of the source, we are able to reorder vertices in advance to exploit locality. Moreover, our algorithm takes advantage of features of modern CPU architectures, such as SSE and multi-core. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, our method needs fewer operations, has better locality, and is better able to exploit parallelism at multi-core and instruction levels. We gain additional speedup when implementing our algorithm on a GPU, where our algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra's algorithm on a high-end CPU. This makes applications based on all-pairs shortest-paths practical for continental-sized road networks. Several algorithms, such as computing the graph diameter, exact arc flags, or centrality measures (exact reaches or betweenness), can be greatly accelerated by our method.},

Although of particular importance for many real-life applications, they have received only very little attention in the vehicle routing literature. This paper describes the new regulations for drivers' working hours in the European Union that entered into force in April 2007. According to the new regulations, motor carriers must organise the work of drivers in such a way that drivers are able to comply with the respective regulations and are made liable for infringements committed by the drivers. This paper shows how motor carriers can schedule driving periods, breaks, rest periods, and handling activities, and presents a large neighbourhood search algorithm capable of generating vehicle tours complying with the new regulations.},

In this paper, we present a scheduling method for the US-TDSP that solves the single time window problem in O({$\lambda$} 2 ) time. We show that in the case of multiple time windows the same complexity can be achieved if the gap between subsequent time windows is at least 10 hours. This situation occurs, for example, if, because of opening hours of docks, handling operations can only be performed between 8.00 A.M. and 10.00 P.M. Furthermore, we empirically show that for a wide range of other problem instances the computational effort is not much higher if multiple time windows are considered.},

In contrast to conventional route planning, truck drivers have to obey government regulations that impose limits on non-stop driving times. Therefore, route planners must plan break periods in advance and select suitable parking lots. To ensure that maximum driving times are not exceeded, predictable congestion due to, e.~g., peak hours should also be taken into account. Therefore, we introduce the truck driver routing problem in time-dependent road networks. It turns out that the combination of time-dependent driving times with constraints imposed by drivers' working hours requires computation of multiple time-dependent profiles for optimal solutions. Although conceptually simple, profile search is expensive. We greatly reduce (empirical) running times by calculating bounds on arrival and departure times during additional search phases to only query partial profiles and only to a fraction of the parking lots. Carefully integrating this approach with a one-to-many extension of time-dependent contraction hierarchies makes our approach practical. For even faster queries, we also propose a heuristic variant that works very well in practice. Excellent performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on a recent real-world instance of Germany that is much harder than time-dependent instances considered in previous works.},

  doi = {10.5445/IR/1000097855},
  abstract = {In many countries, truck drivers are obliged by law to take a break or a rest regularly. In the European Union, for example, this is governed by Regulation (EC) No. 561/2006. It states that, after 4.5 hours of driving a truck, it is prohibited to continue driving until a 45-minute break is taken. After accumulating a driving time of 9 hours, a rest of 11 hours is mandatory. These are only two rules of a considerably longer list of break rules set out in this regulation, and it is only one of many regulations there are worldwide. Such breaks and rests have to be planned into the work schedules of the drivers. In general, the task of a dispatcher is to find routes and schedules for the truck drivers such that every customer is served in time. With the regulations on drivers' working hours, both the routing and the scheduling parts of the task become more challenging. In this thesis, we study several optimization problems that arise in the context of drivers' working hours. One is known as the truck driver scheduling problem. Here, a sequence of customers is given, and the task is to find a schedule for a driver such that every customer is visited within one of the customer's time windows and the applicable break rules are complied with. Depending on the regarded break rules, we get different variants of the truck driver scheduling problem. Little is known about the complexity of the individual problem variants. One of the two focal points of this thesis is to present polynomial-time algorithms for different variants of the problem, for which polynomial-time algorithms are not yet known. With this, we can falsify the NP-hardness conjecture of Xu et al. (2003) for an important special case of their considered problem variant. But this thesis is not only about scheduling, it is also about routing. This constitutes the second focal point of this thesis. We present an integrated approach for the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem. Here, a route refers to the order in which the customers are visited. However, the meaning of route is twofold. In another studied problem, the truck driver scheduling and routing problem, it means the sequence of road segments that the driver takes to drive from one customer to the other. In this problem, we take into account that, before taking a break, truck drivers need to head for a rest area or at least a spot where their vehicle can be parked. We even consider the time-dependent scenario in which driving times on road segments vary over the day due to rush hours. Both an exact approach and a heuristic for this problem are presented, and both are evaluated on a recent road network instance of Germany. It turns out that the heuristic is at least two orders of magnitude faster but still hardly worse than the exact approach. Our main motivation is the application in practice. It is our aim \textendash{} and this is especially true for the second focal point \textendash{} to provide helpful algorithms that may find their way into software products for dispatchers, like the described approach for the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem is already integrated into the vehicle route planning tools of a commercial provider of logistics optimization software.},

In this setting, feasible routes may require waiting at parking areas, and several feasible routes with different trade-offs between waiting and driving detours around closed areas may exist. We propose a novel model in which driving and waiting are assigned abstract costs, and waiting costs are location-dependent to reflect the different quality of the parking areas. Our goal is to find Pareto-optimal routes with regards to arrival time at the destination and total cost. We investigate the complexity of the model and determine a necessary constraint on the cost parameters such that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We present a thoroughly engineered implementation and perform experiments on a production-grade real world data set. The experiments show that our implementation can answer realistic queries in around a second or less which makes it feasible for practical application.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology to identify the economic impact of different policies for heavy vehicle routing and driver scheduling in long-haul full-load trips with intermediate stops for refueling and for regulation-driven meal and rest periods. This methodology can be used both as a planning tool to help policy-makers define policies through scenario simulations, and as an evaluation tool to examine ex-post economic impact once policies have been changed as illustrated herein for the Brazilian case. The paper introduces a mathematical formulation, proposes a state-space graph search approach, and develops an algorithmic solution for a variant of the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem with intermediate stops (VRTDSPIS), which is especially important in countries with vast territory where long-range freight trucking trips are common. In addition, it is particularly relevant for the economies of emerging markets that may have evolving regulatory frameworks and suboptimal infrastructure environments. Regulatory maximum driving and minimum driver resting time windows impose significant constraints to trucker routines, especially in sparsely populated regions through which long range vehicle trips with full load are common. Such trips can take days to be concluded and numerous alternative routes are possible, each with very different alternatives for refueling and rest. While the literature to date has focused mostly on truck driver scheduling given pre-determined routes and individual country's laws and regulations, this paper proposes a joint solution for the routing and scheduling problem with time window constraints, determining simultaneously a routing and scheduling plan that meets all maximum driving and minimum resting time interval regulatory requirements at minimum cost. An illustration applying the methodology to evaluate the economic impact of truck driver regulatory changes in Brazil is presented.},

  journal = {Scheduling hours of service for truck drivers with interdependent routes},
  abstract = {When transporting goods, truck drivers may have to perform load transfers between two vehicles at cross-dock or transfer locations. These transfers create interdependencies between the routes of different truck drivers and require careful temporal synchronization. The situation becomes even more complex when driver schedules must comply with customer time windows, working periods and regulatory resting requirements. Although the scheduling of hours of service for truck drivers is a well-known problem, existing algorithms cannot cope with interdependent routes. Successfully accommodating this real-world characteristic demands the introduction of a new, more general truck scheduling problem: The Truck Driver Scheduling Problem with Interdependent Routes. This paper introduces a mathematical model and a label propagation algorithm to solve this new problem. Experiments indicate that the algorithm can quickly schedule a large number of interdependent routes and outperforms a mathematical programming approach. The algorithm produces valid schedules for multiple drivers and thus becomes a foundation for future vehicle routing algorithms that address interdependent routes and hours of service regulations.},

  abstract = {Driver fatigue is the cause of many truck crashes taking place today. In order to improve safety, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has implemented revised Hours-of-Service (HOS) regulations effective on October 1\^st 2005. According to the revised rules, drivers should take a break of 10 consecutive hours after 11 hours of driving time or 14 hours of duty time that includes driving time and service time such as loading and unloading cargo. This has caused a severe increase in the cost for the trucking industry which in turn hurt shippers and ultimately customers. A systematic way for routing vehicles to avoid traffic congestion and waiting due to truck arrival outside the customer service windows, as well as coordinating the timing drivers are taking their mandatory breaks, can improve the efficiency and safety of supply chain distribution operations. In this Thesis, a single truck routing and driver scheduling model with time-dependent travel times, HOS regulations, multiple delivery locations and service time windows is formulated and solved. The objective is to minimize the total time required to serve a given number of customers. The components of the total time are travel time, driver's break time, and waiting time and service time at the customer locations. For each segment of the transportation network, traffic congestion is modeled by using speed distribution profiles over the course of a day, which in turn makes the time required to traverse a highway segment dependent on the time the truck started traversing it. For a given set of customer locations, the optimization model determines the order in which they should be visited and the route between the consecutive customer locations in order to minimize the time of the tour subject to service time windows, HOS restrictions and time-dependent highway traversal times. A Simulated Annealing metaheuristic is implemented to obtain near optimal solutions of the problem. Our experimental results show that the heuristic provides good quality solutions for large size problems (with an average deviation of less than 1\% from the optimal) in reasonable computation time. The accuracy comparison was obtained by solving smaller size problems consisting ofAnnouncement of 10 customers by explicit enumeration. The mathematical model and the solution approach can be easily adapted to more complex problems involving multiple capacitated vehicles with pickup and delivery.},

  abstract = {We study exact, efficient and practical algorithms for route planning in large road networks. Routing applications often require integrating the current traffic situation, planning ahead with traffic predictions for the future, respecting forbidden turns, and many other features depending on the exact application. While Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve these problems, it is too slow for many applications. A* is a classical approach to accelerate Dijkstra's algorithm. A* can support many extended scenarios without much additional implementation complexity. However, A*'s performance depends on the availability of a good heuristic that estimates distances. Computing tight distance estimates is a challenge on its own. On road networks, shortest paths can also be quickly computed using hierarchical speedup techniques. They achieve speed and exactness but sacrifice A*'s flexibility. Extending them to certain practical applications can be hard. In this paper, we present an algorithm to efficiently extract distance estimates for A* from Contraction Hierarchies (CH), a hierarchical technique. We call our heuristic CH-Potentials. Our approach allows decoupling the supported extensions from the hierarchical speed-up technique. Additionally, we describe A* optimizations to accelerate the processing of low degree nodes, which often occur in road networks.},

  abstract = {Mandatory breaks for truck drivers are nowadays scheduled after the route has been decided. However, in some cases it is beneficial to plan these breaks during waiting time caused by truck driving bans. Optimally planning a single break considering driving bans can be done using Dijkstra's algorithm with multiple labels. This has large effects on predicted travel times: 17\% of the analysed routes having a night rest obtain an earlier arrival time by 5 hours on average. However, the computation times of this algorithm are long. A novel heuristic version of time-dependent contraction hierarchies leads to significant reductions in computation times from several seconds to several milliseconds per route. Experiments show that the solutions are still optimal for a representative test set consisting of 10,000 route queries.},
