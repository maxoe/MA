For road networks, we show that one can compute driving directions in milliseconds or less even at continental scale. A variety of techniques provide different trade-offs between preprocessing effort, space requirements, and query time. Some algorithms can answer queries in a fraction of a microsecond, while others can deal efficiently with real-time traffic. Journey planning on public transportation systems, although conceptually similar, is a significantly harder problem due to its inherent time-dependent and multicriteria nature. Although exact algorithms are fast enough for interactive queries on metropolitan transit systems, dealing with continent-sized instances requires simplifications or heavy preprocessing. The multimodal route planning problem, which seeks journeys combining schedule-based transportation (buses, trains) with unrestricted modes (walking, driving), is even harder, relying on approximate solutions even for metropolitan inputs.},

After a quick preprocessing phase, we can compute all distances from a given source in the graph with essentially a linear sweep over all vertices. Because this sweep is independent of the source, we are able to reorder vertices in advance to exploit locality. Moreover, our algorithm takes advantage of features of modern CPU architectures, such as SSE and multi-core. Compared to Dijkstra's algorithm, our method needs fewer operations, has better locality, and is better able to exploit parallelism at multi-core and instruction levels. We gain additional speedup when implementing our algorithm on a GPU, where our algorithm is up to three orders of magnitude faster than Dijkstra's algorithm on a high-end CPU. This makes applications based on all-pairs shortest-paths practical for continental-sized road networks. Several algorithms, such as computing the graph diameter, exact arc flags, or centrality measures (exact reaches or betweenness), can be greatly accelerated by our method.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of computing time-dependent shortest routes for truck drivers. In contrast to conventional route planning, truck drivers have to obey government regulations that impose limits on non-stop driving times. Therefore, route planners must plan break periods in advance and select suitable parking lots. To ensure that maximum driving times are not exceeded, predictable congestion due to, e.~g., peak hours should also be taken into account. Therefore, we introduce the truck driver routing problem in time-dependent road networks. It turns out that the combination of time-dependent driving times with constraints imposed by drivers' working hours requires computation of multiple time-dependent profiles for optimal solutions. Although conceptually simple, profile search is expensive. We greatly reduce (empirical) running times by calculating bounds on arrival and departure times during additional search phases to only query partial profiles and only to a fraction of the parking lots. Carefully integrating this approach with a one-to-many extension of time-dependent contraction hierarchies makes our approach practical. For even faster queries, we also propose a heuristic variant that works very well in practice. Excellent performance of our algorithms is demonstrated on a recent real-world instance of Germany that is much harder than time-dependent instances considered in previous works.},

For heavy vehicles, such areas may be very large since many European countries impose temporary driving bans during the night or on weekends. In this setting, feasible routes may require waiting at parking areas, and several feasible routes with different trade-offs between waiting and driving detours around closed areas may exist. We propose a novel model in which driving and waiting are assigned abstract costs, and waiting costs are location-dependent to reflect the different quality of the parking areas. Our goal is to find Pareto-optimal routes with regards to arrival time at the destination and total cost. We investigate the complexity of the model and determine a necessary constraint on the cost parameters such that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We present a thoroughly engineered implementation and perform experiments on a production-grade real world data set. The experiments show that our implementation can answer realistic queries in around a second or less which makes it feasible for practical application.},

This methodology can be used both as a planning tool to help policy-makers define policies through scenario simulations, and as an evaluation tool to examine ex-post economic impact once policies have been changed as illustrated herein for the Brazilian case. The paper introduces a mathematical formulation, proposes a state-space graph search approach, and develops an algorithmic solution for a variant of the vehicle routing and truck driver scheduling problem with intermediate stops (VRTDSPIS), which is especially important in countries with vast territory where long-range freight trucking trips are common. In addition, it is particularly relevant for the economies of emerging markets that may have evolving regulatory frameworks and suboptimal infrastructure environments. Regulatory maximum driving and minimum driver resting time windows impose significant constraints to trucker routines, especially in sparsely populated regions through which long range vehicle trips with full load are common. Such trips can take days to be concluded and numerous alternative routes are possible, each with very different alternatives for refueling and rest. While the literature to date has focused mostly on truck driver scheduling given pre-determined routes and individual country's laws and regulations, this paper proposes a joint solution for the routing and scheduling problem with time window constraints, determining simultaneously a routing and scheduling plan that meets all maximum driving and minimum resting time interval regulatory requirements at minimum cost. An illustration applying the methodology to evaluate the economic impact of truck driver regulatory changes in Brazil is presented.},

  abstract = {When transporting goods, truck drivers may have to perform load transfers between two vehicles at cross-dock or transfer locations. These transfers create interdependencies between the routes of different truck drivers and require careful temporal synchronization. The situation becomes even more complex when driver schedules must comply with customer time windows, working periods and regulatory resting requirements. Although the scheduling of hours of service for truck drivers is a well-known problem, existing algorithms cannot cope with interdependent routes. Successfully accommodating this real-world characteristic demands the introduction of a new, more general truck scheduling problem: The Truck Driver Scheduling Problem with Interdependent Routes. This paper introduces a mathematical model and a label propagation algorithm to solve this new problem. Experiments indicate that the algorithm can quickly schedule a large number of interdependent routes and outperforms a mathematical programming approach. The algorithm produces valid schedules for multiple drivers and thus becomes a foundation for future vehicle routing algorithms that address interdependent routes and hours of service regulations.},

Routing applications often require integrating the current traffic situation, planning ahead with traffic predictions for the future, respecting forbidden turns, and many other features depending on the exact application. While Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve these problems, it is too slow for many applications. A* is a classical approach to accelerate Dijkstra's algorithm. A* can support many extended scenarios without much additional implementation complexity. However, A*'s performance depends on the availability of a good heuristic that estimates distances. Computing tight distance estimates is a challenge on its own. On road networks, shortest paths can also be quickly computed using hierarchical speedup techniques. They achieve speed and exactness but sacrifice A*'s flexibility. Extending them to certain practical applications can be hard. In this paper, we present an algorithm to efficiently extract distance estimates for A* from Contraction Hierarchies (CH), a hierarchical technique. We call our heuristic CH-Potentials. Our approach allows decoupling the supported extensions from the hierarchical speed-up technique. Additionally, we describe A* optimizations to accelerate the processing of low degree nodes, which often occur in road networks.},

This has large effects on predicted travel times: 17\% of the analysed routes having a night rest obtain an earlier arrival time by 5 hours on average. However, the computation times of this algorithm are long. A novel heuristic version of time-dependent contraction hierarchies leads to significant reductions in computation times from several seconds to several milliseconds per route.
