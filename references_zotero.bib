  abstract = {We study the problem of finding a shortest path between two vertices in a directed graph. This is an important problem with many applications, including that of computing driving directions. We allow preprocessing the graph using a linear amount of extra space to store auxiliary information, and using this information to answer shortest path queries quickly. Our approach uses A {${_\ast}$} search in combination with a new graph-theoretic lower-bounding technique based on landmarks and the triangle inequality. We also develop new bidirectional variants of A {${_\ast}$} search and investigate several variants of the new algorithms to find those that are most efficient in practice. Our algorithms compute optimal shortest paths and work on any directed graph. We give experimental results showing that the most efficient of our new algorithms outperforms previous algorithms, in particular A {${_\ast}$} search with Euclidean bounds, by a wide margin on road networks. We also experiment with several synthetic graph families.},

Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of planning routes in road networks when certain streets or areas are closed at certain times. For heavy vehicles, such areas may be very large since many European countries impose temporary driving bans during the night or on weekends. In this setting, feasible routes may require waiting at parking areas, and several feasible routes with different trade-offs between waiting and driving detours around closed areas may exist. We propose a novel model in which driving and waiting are assigned abstract costs, and waiting costs are location-dependent to reflect the different quality of the parking areas. Our goal is to find Pareto-optimal routes with regards to arrival time at the destination and total cost. We investigate the complexity of the model and determine a necessary constraint on the cost parameters such that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We present a thoroughly engineered implementation and perform experiments on a production-grade real world data set. The experiments show that our implementation can answer realistic queries in around a second or less which makes it feasible for practical application.},

  author = {Strasser, Ben and Zeitz, Tim},
  year = {2021},
  pages = {16},
  abstract = {We study exact, efficient and practical algorithms for route planning in large road networks. Routing applications often require integrating the current traffic situation, planning ahead with traffic predictions for the future, respecting forbidden turns, and many other features depending on the exact application. While Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve these problems, it is too slow for many applications. A* is a classical approach to accelerate Dijkstra's algorithm. A* can support many extended scenarios without much additional implementation complexity. However, A*'s performance depends on the availability of a good heuristic that estimates distances. Computing tight distance estimates is a challenge on its own. On road networks, shortest paths can also be quickly computed using hierarchical speedup techniques. They achieve speed and exactness but sacrifice A*'s flexibility. Extending them to certain practical applications can be hard. In this paper, we present an algorithm to efficiently extract distance estimates for A* from Contraction Hierarchies (CH), a hierarchical technique. We call our heuristic CH-Potentials. Our approach allows decoupling the supported extensions from the hierarchical speed-up technique. Additionally, we describe A* optimizations to accelerate the processing of low degree nodes, which often occur in road networks.},
